EmailSubject: iFindStuff Plugin - Update Now Available
EmailBody: The iFindStuff Plugin you are using has been updated. There's been some changes to the iFindStuff Plugin and you asked Indigo to let you know when new features were available.

The changes user driven and include:

1. Ability to show distances to a set number of decimal places (e.g. 10.34)
2. Ability to show distances in a more user friendly form (10 miles 3ft or 10 km and 56m or 1456m)

There will be a further update this week to include a number of features that users have requested :D

As always, if something doesn't seem quite right, please let me know.
